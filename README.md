Time-is-Money
=============

How much is your time worth?


This is a Chrome Plugin that will help you better uderstand the value of your money. It takes how much you make an hour and converts prices on the pages you visit into the time it would take you to buy that item.

For example: You make  8mins/hr
You want to buy a Phone that costs  9hrs 2mins

It will show as: 11 hours

It also calculates days, hours, and minutes.

It has a RegEx to dedect price patterns.

It's my first plugin!

To Do:
1. Pretty up the options page

2. Investigate js bug on some pages

3. Make time appear next to prices, instead of replacing them

4. Make a landing page
